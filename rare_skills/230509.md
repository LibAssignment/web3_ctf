# Problem: Security101

Here we go again!
Your mission is to hack Security101.sol in
https://github.com/RareSkills/gas-puzzles
... gas efficiently.
Don't be fooled by how simple it looks Your first solution probably won't work. ðŸ˜Ž

contract: https://github.com/RareSkills/gas-puzzles/blob/de479bff09544c645d07023c144e260188305258/contracts/Security101.sol

# Hint
1. we have to separate in 2 contracts, since in `contructor`, code haven't been deployed
2. `selfdestruct` saves ~7.6k in `OptimizedAttackerSecurity101` and ~9.9k for `transfer`
3. key is to reduce "deployed code" size of `AttackerMiddle` (after `selfdestruct`, code for `OptimizedAttackerSecurity101` costs nothing)
   * move `deposit` to `constructor`, since it would not appears in deployed code, saves ~100b/~20k
   * use internal/public method for `withdraw`, saves ~83b/~17k per occurance
   * use bytecode like `msg.sender`, `tx.origin`, `msg.value`, `address(self).balance` and even `block.number` instead of hardcoded value, saves ~8b/~1.6k per const, note `address(token).balance` valid only when token is a variable but not constant
   * every `payable` saves 12b/~2.4k per function
   * use `fallback` instead of `receive` saves 13b/~2.6k

## Tricks
1. do not send back ether due to bug in test, saves ~9.7k
2. hardcode victim address and then you do all logic in fallback, saves ~15.5k
